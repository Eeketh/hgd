Developer Guidelines for HGD
============================

Code Style
----------

Code style is as described in the style(9) OpenBSD manual page.
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9

All of our functions (other than helpers funcs) are prefixed 'hgd_'

Code Partitioning
-----------------

Each program has it's own source file.

All database code should go in db.c. Be sure to protect these macros against SQL
injection. This means doing sql queries the long way if the query is dynamic.

All of our macros are defined in .h files and are prefixed HGD_ other
than in certain (generic) cases (SERROR for example).

Any other common functionality should go in common.c.

Debugging
---------

Debugging is done via DPRINTF at the appropriate debug level. Generally
speaking:
#define HGD_D_ERROR	- Failures which we can not recover from.
#define HGD_D_WARN	- Warnings which we can be recovered from.
#define HGD_D_INFO	- Info that might tbe useful at runtime.
#define HGD_D_DEBUG	- Very verbose info for debugging.

When debugging netd, there is the -f flag which causes netd to not fork; this
can be useful for valgrinding a single run.

Cleaning Up On Exit
-------------------

Exit is done via hgd_exit_nicely() -- each program has it's own
implementation. You should try to call this as far up the call stack
as possible, so that as much stuff is free()d/closed as possible
before exit.

Always valgrind your work. For this you need a linux machine. Make sure
that none of your code "definitely loses" bytes, as this is a memory
leak. Sometimes it is hard as libraries tend to leak. Also Python's
PyMalloc implementation spews a ton of invalid reads; however, these
invalid reads should not cause bytes being "definitely lost". It's
difficult, but try your best.

If you change or add Python functions using the C API, please check
religiously for reference leaks.

If you are developing on OpenBSD, turn on the 'S' malloc flag (see malloc(3)).
This will detect use after frees.

Documentation
-------------

If you pull in a new library, add it to the list of prerequisites in README.

When you add a command line switch, update the manual and don't forget to bump
the .Dd line too. The format of .Dd is 'Month DD, YYYY'. If you are on OpenBSD,
lint the manual using 'mandoc -Tlint'.

Misc
----

If you break backward compatibility in the network protocol, then you must bump
HGD_PROTO_VERSION in hgd.h.

Rolling a Release
-----------------

 1.   You have already valgrinded and tested with various modules enabled ;)
      You have also stress tested any Python/C extension functions which have
      been added or changed since the last release.
 2.   Turn off debug flag (-g in CFLAGS).
 3.   Bump version macro.
 4.   Check README has history updated.
 5.   Run "make pydoc" and remove the FILE sections from the output (sigh).
 6.   Run (on an OpenBSD host) 'make lint-mans'. Fix any man bugs.
 7.   Commit and push to git.
 8.   If this is a major version, make a branch in git. Eg. "0.4.x". Push it.
 9.   Tag the version in git. It should be tagged as 'x.x.x', eg '0.2.1'. Push.
 10.  Turn debug flag back on. Push.
 11.  Get a tarball of tag off github.
 12.  Untar it.
 13.  Rename the directory hgd-x.x.x
 14.  Generate the configure script (autogen.sh)
 15.  Tar it up the whole dir as hgd-x.x.x.tar.gz (not .tgz)
 16.  Upload it to github.

 Optionally:
 14. Send notification to reddit.com/r/software ;)
 15. ??????
 16. PROFIT!

Protocol Changes
----------------

Version 1 was never named really. At this stage HGD was small and backward
compatibility was not being considered.

Version 2 saw the addition of a password on the 'user' command.

Version 3 saw a change in the response of 'q', from 'ok...' to 'ok|...'. Also
artist and title tags are transmitted in responses to 'np' and 'ls'.

For full protocol documentation, see the hgd-proto(1) manual page.


Want To Contribute?
-------------------

If you want to contribute, make a github fork and send a vext01/hgd a
pull request.  Make sure you have your git client configured correctly
with respect to user.name and user.email. They should be the same as
on github.

If your changes are significant, please add your name to the copyrights
on source files you have changed and also add yourself to version() in 
common.c.

Plain diffs can also be accepted via email (vext01 at gmail dot com).
