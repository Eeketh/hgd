Hackathon Gunther Daemon
=========================

HGD is a music system suitable for hackathons, internet cafes, LAN
parties etc. Music is played on one set of speakers and clients queue up
media from their own machines over the network. Because we use MPlayer to play
media, you can send anything MPlayer understands, including video.

HGD was inspired by the LPD hack -- a music system used at OpenBSD
hackathons. We plan to implement similar functionality and extend it.

Current features
----------------

 * Network listener daemon.
 * Player daemon (uses mplayer).
 * Command line client with the ability queue and vote-off tracks.
 * Works on Linux and OpenBSD.

Prerequisites
-------------

To build, you will need:

 * Linux or OpenBSD (possibly others, not tested)
 * Make (either GNU or BSD)
 * GCC or Clang
 * SQLite3 libs and headers (if building servers).
 * OpenSSL libs and headers.
 * LibBSD (linux only) libs and headers.
 * Mplayer (for the server)

Building
--------

The build system is both bmake and gmake compatible, as it stands we use
only make.

 * To build everything, type 'make'.
 * To build only the client type 'make hgdc'.

Running
-------

First you should make user accounts:

 % hgd-admin user-add <username>

Then you can run the hgd daemons:

 % hgd-netd
 % hgd-playd

If you don't have permission to /var/hgd, you can use a different place for
the state directory; pass '-d <path>' to hgd-playd, hgd-netd and hgd-admin.

Then you can queue tracks:
 % hgdc q <some media file>

Each command has a manual page for detailed usage instructions. Also,
each command has a '-h' option for quick help. 

If you do not want to show the video of media files, 'unset DISPLAY'
before running hgd-playd.

For information on SSL (TLSv1) crypto, see the manual page for
hgd-netd(1).

Please note that SSL support in HGD is only partially implemented at
this time. You may use it for encrypting traffic, but not for server
identity.

History
-------

 * 0.1 - basic functionality.
 * 0.2 - SSL crypto support and user authentication.
 * 0.3 - Config file support.
